The latter is far more spread out in terms of radii, rather than being 'squished' down near the x-axis for the former. While the graph has loose form, it does indicate that stars tend to either have small or large relative radii, with little inbetween, alongside a range of luminosities."

Within the dataset, most of the points are below 1 and above 10000, with a large variation in luminosity. This can be largely attributed to the nature of the relative luminosity value. It's formula is simply a constant multiplied by the size of the star and the temperature raised to the fourth power. When adjusted to a logarithmic scale (10^x), the graph seems to conform to the exponential growth curve with two clusters of outliers, similar to the relationship between temperature and absolute magnitude.")

The first group is located when the absolute magnitude is less than -5. Despite their low absolute magnitudes (high brightness), they have incredibly low temperatures.

From the temperature graph, it is evident that stars with lower temperature (<5000k) appear more often than those with higher temperatures. "
